                  Phase represents the current execution phase of a resource.
                  This enum is used consistently across all execution resources (Stories, StoryRuns, StepRuns)
                  to provide a unified view of execution state.

                  The phase progression typically follows:
                  Pending → Running → {Succeeded|Failed|Canceled|Compensated|Paused|Blocked|Scheduling|Timeout|Aborted}

                  Some resources may also support Paused for manual intervention scenarios.

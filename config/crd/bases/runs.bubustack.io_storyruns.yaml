          StoryRun represents an actual execution instance of a Story

          Think of the relationship like this:
          - Story = A movie script (defines what should happen)
          - StoryRun = Actually filming the movie (executing the script with specific actors and locations)

          Every time a Story is triggered (by an Impulse, manual trigger, or another Story),
          a new StoryRun is created to track that specific execution.

          StoryRuns are the "run history" of your automation - they show:
          - When each story execution started and finished
          - What inputs were provided
          - Which steps succeeded or failed
          - What outputs were produced
          - Any errors that occurred
